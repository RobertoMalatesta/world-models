This package contains two directories: world-dynamics and world3.

The first directory, world-dynamics, contains an implementation of Jay
Wright Forrester's World Dynamics model in C++ and Javascript. The
Javascript version can be embedded in a web page and you can find an
example of that, too. Check the index.html page.

The second directory, world3, contains the start of an implementation
of the World3 model that was used by the Club of Rome and described in
the book Limits to Growth. The code is unfinished.
